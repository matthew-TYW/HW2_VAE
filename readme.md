A PyTorch implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed to generate high-resolution ($256 \times 256$) synthetic chest X-ray images. This project includes custom model architectures, real-time evaluation using FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) and IS (Inception Score), and scripts for both training and inference.
